## RLHF on base model for reasoning and CoT

## Using LLM-as-a-Judge for Automated Formalized Evaluation
1. **Why**: consistency, inherent subjectivity, and scale of evaluation.
2. **Goals**: consistency, bias-free, adpative to diverse scenarios, reliability.
3. **Use cases**: for Models, for Agents, for Data, for Reasoning/Thinking.
4. **Philosophy**: Formalizing the subjective by using LLMs.
5. **Alternatives**: Expert-driven, or metric-based evaluation.
6. **Attacks**: Adversarial prompt manipulation, contextual framing biases.
7. **Challenges**: Multimodal inputs.
8. Future work: 
    * **Reliability**: Self-consistency, Uncertainty calibration, bias mitigation.
    * **Robustness/Adversarial-Resistant** Evaluation: Prompt engineering, and sensitivity to context.
    * **Generalization**: Multimodal input, domain-adaptive learning, integrating structured knowledge.
